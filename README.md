# Plutocratic hosting contract

This contract will store content under a route for the largest bidder. Each time content is replaced, the previous owner will be refunded their original amount. The contract owner can withdraw these funds at any time.

This is just arbitrary logic for a contract to compare the different smart contract environments.
